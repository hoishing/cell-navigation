## Why?

I'd like to bring the handy cell navigating experience from Jupyter Notebook to Atom.

## Moving Cells

- Move the cell under the cursor up / down
- Move multiple cells at once on selected range of text
- Add cell mark `# %%` automatically for top cell
- All moves are undo-able

## Cell Selection

- select single at cursor position
- select multiple cells on selected range of text
- select adjacent cells with shortcut keys

## Do it all together

- navigate, select and move cells with only shortcut keys
